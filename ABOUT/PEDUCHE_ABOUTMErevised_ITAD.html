    <h2><mark>CHILDHOOD YEARS</mark></h2>
	
	
    <div>
    	<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; I've spent all of my childhood in playing different kinds of games like physical games and tech related games.<sup>1</sup>
		Whenever the clock hits 5:30 PM I would always ask to my mother to allow me to play outside with my cousins.<sup>2</sup>
		I was first introduced in playing <i>maiba taya</i> it involves running and avoiding to be touched by enemy player.<sup>3</sup>
		When we reached to the point that we get bored easily in that game, I was introduced in playing badminton and basketball by my siblings then we start playing as a routine in the morning.<sup>4</sup>
		During those days, It was fun and exciting to play different kinds of physical activities.<sup>5</sup>At some point I was about to start my school days since my age at that time is suitable for school age requirements.
		<sup>6</sup>I've learned different kinds of things during that time such as animals, space, and math.<sup>7</sup>
		One of the remarkable things that I've remember during that time is that we are allowed to play if we managed to finished our seatwork which motivates my classmates including myself.<sup>8</sup>
		But during those days, my cousins are busy to their own school activities since I am younger than them they are far more involved to schools unlike me because I am still in my kinder days.<sup>9</sup>
		Since then I could no longer go outside just to play since they are busy.<sup>10</sup>
		Luckily my father brought us a Playstation 1, it was a console game device which allows the user to play different kinds of games depending on the CD provided.<sup>11</sup>
		I was baffled when I saw that device because I don’t know how to use and play those controllers.<sup>12</sup>
		My father decided to teach us how to use it and even how to assemble and insert the cords to their corresponding ports.<sup>13</sup>
		Before we start playing, my father told us to never overuse the Playstation because he doesn’t want us to get addicted in playing which will affect our studies.<sup>14</sup> 
		I really enjoyed playing different games in Playstation such as Digimon 3, Doom, Need for Speed, and R-Type Delta.<sup>15</sup>
		Since it can only allow 2 players we take turns on who will play next so for 3 boys it is needed to be fair so that there will do conflicts.<sup>16</sup>
		Playing those games was challenging for me since I am still a kid at that time I have a difficulty in following the instructions due to I am still not familiar to some English words.<sup>17</sup> 
		My father kind of noticed about that issue regarding to my difficulty in following instructions so he show me one game where I can easily play since it does not require difficult instructions.<sup>18</sup>
		I could no longer remember the name of that game but I am sure that I really enjoyed that game since I can still remember some of its designs and soundtrack used in the game.<sup>19</sup> 
		I can really say that my Childhood years is best because I can still remember the details of the games that I've played and even the time where we will play outside.<sup>20</sup></p></blockquote>

    <h2><mark>TEENAGE YEARS</mark></h2>
    <div>
    <blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Here in Vincent teenage years this is where he started to take things seriously especially in his studies.<sup>1</sup>
	There is no time for Vincent and to his cousins to play outside just like in their childhood days but they still hang out by walking along the streets or watching a movie.<sup>2</sup>
	Vincent's mother decided to dispose their playstation the reason for disposal is because it doesn't work anymore the game CD is also faulty and unresponsive.<sup>3</sup>
	It was hard for Vincent at that time to see that it will be disposed because it was full of memories and he was able to finish one game at that time but he was able to keep the controller as a remembrance.<sup>4</sup> 
	His 2 brothers are really busy since they are starting their college while Vincent is just starting his high school years.<sup>5</sup> 
	During that time, it was weird for him to see different kinds of subjects in my school because Vincent simply thought that education revolves only in Math, Science, English,and Filipino.<sup>6</sup>
	Another thing is that his parents started to not help him in his assignments but the reason for this is to allow Vincent to do tasks in his own way.<sup>7</sup>
	It was challenging for Vincent so he have to learn all of the topics in his own way but the good thing here is that our family has Internet access.<sup>8</sup> 
	During that time, his family was able to build a PC which allows us to do our assignments and play some games.<sup>9</sup> 
	It was also that time when he discovered several online games like League of Legends, Dragon Nest, and Ragnarok.<sup>10</sup> 
	He started to play those games whenever he finished his assignments but Vincent have to limit himself in 1-2 games since his brothers need it the most for their college handouts.<sup>11</sup> 
	One of the remarkable things that Vincent saw in his teenage years is how it developed to my brothers the concept of love to them.<sup>12</sup> 
	In those days, Vincent seen how they create customize box with ribbons and how they save their money to buy stuffed toys or any kinds of gifts.<sup>13</sup> 
	Vincent was shy to ask what is love to his family so he just kind of leave it since he is not interested to get involved in that kind of aspect.<sup>14</sup> 
	One of his brothers was able to finish college, Vincent's eldest brother was able to finish his Nursing in his school.<sup>15</sup> By the time he finished his Junior High School, Vincent was put again in a situation where he have to choose a school for his Senior High School.<sup>16</sup> 
	Vincent was not really motivated to study in a prestigious school so he just let his parents to give him a list and take their entrance exam.<sup>17</sup> 
	The list goes on from PUP, FEU, UE, and TUA although Vincent school in his JHS is allowing them to enroll for SHS he simply declined the offer since he don't want to stick with the same professors and classmates.<sup>18</sup> 
	The love part finally hits Vincent when he was starting his SHS days it was weird for him because it was the first time that Vincent is interested in that person's life and even to her hobbies.<sup>19</sup> 
	He can say that his teenage years is like a opening a door that will lead to another door probably because Vincent is still starting to take things seriously.<sup>20</sup></p></blockquote>

    <h2><mark>COLLEGE YEARS</mark></h2>
    <div>
    <blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Here in my college years Vincent realized that he is moving to his future aspect of his life.<sup>1</sup> 
	College years or college life is basically the crucial part of Vincent's life because it is the part where his capabilities will be put into the test if he is worthy to be a programmer.<sup>2</sup>
	He decided to enroll in UE because he have failed to obtain the scholarship in FEUTech.<sup>3</sup> 
	It was hard for him to enroll in a different school where he doesn't have any friends that will also study in UE.<sup>4</sup> 
	Vincent tried to take the entrance exam is TIP, and TUA but by the time when he was about to finish the requirements needed for entrance exam that is the also the time when he was able to pass the entrance exam of UE.<sup>5</sup> 
	During the first month of studying in UE, it was difficult for Vincent to be active in school because everybody is a stranger to him so in order to have some friends he have to carefully observe to his classmates on who will be kind to talk.<sup>6</sup> 
	Vincent also realized how he is dependent to other people in terms of having social life so he just put myself in a challenge to overcome this problem because he knows that it will affect to his studies.<sup>7</sup> 
	The good thing here is that his professors at that time was kind for any questions given by their students.<sup>8</sup> 
	Vincent also learned how to ask help to his classmates because during his high school days he is shy to ask even simple questions.<sup>9</sup> 
	During that time, Vincent learned different kinds of programming language he can still remember how he is surprised that HTML is not really a language in programming.<sup>10</sup> 
	One of the remarkable things that Vincent realized during that time is when he realized that you need to find your way to understand the lesson so by taking important notes and reviewing after classes is his method of studying that he developed for myself.<sup>11</sup> 
	The stress from college reduced my time from playing games his parents also saw it where Vincent will just watching or reading the modules provided by my professors or lay in his bed.<sup>12</sup> 
	Another thing Vincent remembers is when he was able to meet his old classmates which is a great timing for him because it was the day after his final exam during his 1st year of his college life.<sup>13</sup> 
	The things that happened during that time was full of nostalgia because they always open the routines or the things that they do during their high school days to Vincent it is a great time to rest and laugh with his old friends.<sup>14</sup> 
	He was able to see different eatery due to the influence of his friends which allows him to taste different kinds of foods.<sup>15</sup> 
	One of their routine is to visit the library where Vincent and his friends would play chess or relax when they have extra time before their next class.<sup>16</sup> 
	It was during that time that Vincent realized that having fewer friends is okay and accepted because he learns that those who really value each other are the ones who will help him to improve as a better person.<sup>17</sup> 
	Everything change when the pandemic begins they were all forced to stay inside of their houses which means that they can no longer enter the school premises only if they have an important errands to the school.<sup>18</sup> 
	All students that time including Vincent was given to choose whether to continue their study via online class or modular classes although he choose the online class he knows that it will be difficult to handle not only he needs to participate in his classes but he needs to maintained the good health of his computer.<sup>19</sup> 
	Vincent knows that his college life will be different from his brothers aside from he is engaged in online class it will also test is capabilities if he can perform in a online based class instead of face to face class.<sup>20</sup></p></blockquote>
